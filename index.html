              <p>Nov 3rd</p>

              <p>There’s this one song (anything) you dedicated to us (our song 🤭) — and every time I hear it, it reminds me of you</p>

              <p>“I don't wanna talk about anything, I just wanna kiss your eyes again.”</p>

              <p>Those lines hit me differently every single time. It’s exactly how it feels with you — I don’t need words, I don’t need anything else. Just your presence. Just the quiet comfort that comes with you</p>

              <p> “I wanna sleep in your car while you’re drivin’, lay in your lap when I’m cryin’,” I picture us in that moment — safe, unhurried, and completely ourselves. It’s such a simple image, but it holds everything I want with you: peace, warmth, and a kind of love that doesn’t need to be loud to be real.</p>

              <p>I love how this song became ours. It’s like a secret language between us — no matter where we are, when it plays, it’s you I think of first.</p>

              <p>So today’s letter is short, but it’s full — because this song already says everything I’d ever want to tell you: I don’t want to talk about anything else, anyone else. Just you. Always you.
              AND AND AND
              the letter me sent you on your last bday IT NOMORE APPLICABLE becos you're not going anywhere, you are trapped and shall be caged between my thighs 😈</p>

              <p>Nov 4th</p>

              <p>On your birthday, I just want to pour my heart into words and wish you all the goodness this world can offer — and more.
              I wish you achieve everything you’ve ever dreamt of — the silent goals, the unspoken hopes, and even the wildest dreams that live quietly inside your heart.</p>

              <p>I wish you win all the battles you never talk about — the ones that live behind your calm eyes, the ones no one sees but you fight every single day with strength and grace.</p>

              <p>And when life feels heavy, when the world grows quiet and cold, I pray that Allah makes your path easier — that He fills your heart with peace and your days with light.
              Because even in your lows, you carry a kind of dignity that never fades.</p>

              <p>I wish your soul finds everything — and everyone — that it truly deserves.
              May Allah fill your life with mercy, with joy, with love so pure that it never leaves.</p>

              <p>The soul you bring to this world — it sings.
              It hums softly through the people you touch, through the love you give, through every moment you turn into something beautiful.</p>

              <p>And I’ll be right here — always — watching you grow, loving you through every season, proud beyond words to call you mine.</p>

              <p>(I've added this in our previous letter and I add this again)
              And if we ever lose contact then find me in the rain, the one that are the most unexpected rains.
              Remember me when you feel the raindrops on your skin.
              We might lose contact but not the connection through that invisible string that connects us.</p>

              <p>(The coffee I had is doing its job🤭)
              So here's a poem for you my love</p>

              <p>You move through me like moonlight over water—
              slow, silver, sure.
              Even the sea hushes when your calm arrives,
              as if it knows gentleness can still be power.</p>

              <p>Your warmth is a tide I never resist,
              pulling me softly, completely,
              until I forget where the ocean ends
              and where your touch begins.</p>

              <p>There’s a quiet fire in you,
              something both wild and serene—
              like waves kissing the shore
              while the moon blushes above them.</p>

              <p>You are the stillness after storms,
              the rhythm beneath every silence,
              and every time you breathe,
              the world around me softens</p>

              <p>My dear Haroon,
              My dearest love,</p>

              <p>Today, the world quietly celebrates the day you came into it — 27 years of life, growth, and grace. And while the number changes, what truly matters is how beautifully you’ve evolved with every passing year.</p>

              <p>Growing older isn’t losing time, my love — it’s gaining light. It’s the proof of how far you’ve walked through storms, how bravely you’ve stood when life tested your heart. Every scar, every smile, every sleepless night has shaped the man I so deeply admire today.</p>

              <p>Your soul has grown softer yet stronger, your eyes hold stories of resilience, and your heart — oh, your heart — it beats with the kind of warmth that makes me believe in love, in fate, in us.</p>

              <p>You deserve every good thing this world can offer… and yes, you deserve me too — to love you, care for you, and stand beside you through every rise and fall. I’ll always be your constant, your calm after chaos, your hand to hold when the world feels heavy.</p>

              <p>You are not just my man — you’re my best friend, my peace, my forever. There’s an invisible string between us, woven by something far greater than chance, and I know deep within my soul — it will never break.</p>

              <p>Happy 27th birthday, my love.</p>
